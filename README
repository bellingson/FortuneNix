FortuneNix
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an iPhone implementation of the old school Unix fortune app.

It is a relatively simple first app that I created a while ago in order to learn Objective-C.
It's sales have not made me rich as I once expected.... ;)  So I'll just post the source for 
anyone that may be interested.

Some of the code may not be particularly pretty ;)  But if you're interested in using 
directly using sqlite.. it may be a helpful example. However, I now prefer to use 
Core Data.
